This shift could open new avenues for growth.</li></ul><p>The global market value is forecasted to reach around $12 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% over the next decade. By 2025, spicy biscuits will likely become a mainstream snack in more regions, particularly in Europe and North America, as consumers increasingly favor flavorful, spicy foods.</p><p>In conclusion, the spicy biscuits market is undergoing a transformation that reflects broader snack trends and evolving consumer behaviors.
